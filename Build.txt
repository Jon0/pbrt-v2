To compile PBRT, download source; Make a new directory and cd into this directory from command line, run following commands to build.

cmake <path/to/src>

make

This produces the executable which can be run:

./pbrtmain <pbrt scene file>

to render a series of frames one frame should be used to render the local scene:

Renderer "sampler" "integer differential" 0

this produces a rendering of local scene along with a mask, 

rendering the frames can then be done with 

Renderer "sampler" "integer differential" 1 "string photo" "bgism_whitebalanced.exr" "string local" "local.exr" "string localmask" "localmask.exr"

where the options "string local" and "string localmask" are the files created by the previous run, these get reused by each rendered frame.
